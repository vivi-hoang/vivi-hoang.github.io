Welcome! I started this blog in December 2020 as a way of logging my foray into tech: the decisions I've made, the new tools I've been introduced to, the things I've learned, etc. 

This is a mid-career transition for me. Thus far it has served up plenty of wracking self-doubt and blazing thrills. And that's just from my Java class! But life is too short not to follow your curiosity and try new things.
