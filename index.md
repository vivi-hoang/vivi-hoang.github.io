## CIS641 Project

[GVSU CIS641 Mischief Management](https://github.com/pratik-stha/GVSU-CIS641-MISCHIEF-MANAGEMENT)

For our term project, my partner [Pratik Shrestra](https://github.com/pratik-stha) and I are configuring a calculator app as a way of learning about the software design lifecycle as well as familiarizing ourselves with the Python programming language.

Our goal is for this calculator to be able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), a trig function (sine), and a unit conversion (feet to meters and meters to feet) with the option of adding additional trig functional and units to convert if time allows.
