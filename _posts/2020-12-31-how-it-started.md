*Nevertheless, I share how it started*

I'd been saying for years that I wanted to learn to code but surprise, surprise: It didn't just magically happen as if by osmosis. I'd thought perhaps an opportunity at work would arise that would allow me to learn it while on the job. But that never manifested, so in 2019 I resolved to be more proactive. 

## My first coding class

Although I know there are plenty of different avenues to study this subject on your own, I enjoy learning in-person with others, so I enrolled in a [beginner programming class](https://catalog.grcc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=45&coid=69129) at Grand Rapids Community College. It seemed like a low-key, small-stakes way to get my feet wet.

We got introduced to basic programming principles while using the Ruby programming language. The instructor emphasized how we shouldn't get too bogged down in the programming language; it was the concepts he wanted to understand. Now that I've been exposed to a couple of other programming languages -- Java, Python and JavaScript -- I see what he meant: how the logic is universal whereas each language has its own syntax.

Computer science deals in such abstract concepts that there were times I really struggled to get a handle on the material. (This remains [how it's going](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-it-started-vs-how-its-going). I suspect and have accepted that this will be the case for some time; possibly *forever*.) I still have an unresolved fear of two-dimensional arrays. I remember asking the instructor, "What do you mean, if another programmer can't see my code?" because *the code was right there; we could **all** see it* but I didn't yet know about access levels.

Nevertheless, I also remember the heady joy that came from getting something to work. (Honestly, coding sometimes feels like unmitigated sorcerery.) Over Spring Break the instructor assigned a project that required a considerable leap in comprehension because he'd actually forgotten to teach us some of the key skills we'd need to complete the project. None of us knew it at the time, though.

It took hours of Googling and trial and error but I did it. I got that project done. And it was glorious. 

That first class was fantastic for a number of reasons. It gave me a taste of coding and how to think logically. It gave me a sense of the intense highs and lows you can experience as you hit roadblocks and frustration and then hopefully, eventually, finally, success.
