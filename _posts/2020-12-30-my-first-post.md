*Feeling lost but grateful for the amazing view*

I took my first coding class back in my undergraduate years as a way of fulfilling a science requirement. It was an Intro to Computer Science class and, while I don't remember the language we used, I do distinctly remember thinking there was no way I'd could do this for a career.

I've changed my mind.

Over the years, I have worked as a number of things -- journalist, English-language teacher, librarian, webmaster -- and I love working with communities, stories and information. But I also wanted to learn how to do more with that knowledge and solve problems using digital tools. So I'm doing it.

In Fall 2020 I enrolled full-time in Grand Valley State University's [Master's of Applied Computer Science Program](https://www.gvsu.edu/grad/appliedcompsci/). GVSU is [based in Allendale](https://goo.gl/maps/s411uG8oaZ1YASU7A), just outside of Grand Rapids in Western Michigan. 

This is my coding journey. I've learned so much already and look forward to what's to come.
