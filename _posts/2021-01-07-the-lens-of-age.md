*In which I appreciate the lens of age and experience*

Computer science may be a new field to me but as I embarked on my foray into this subject I realized computer science touches too much for us, as the general public, to not have escaped its influence. On top of that, I've worked for a number of years as a webmaster, managing websites for different organizations, which made my duties directly tech-adjacent. 

Following that [first coding class](https://vivi-hoang.github.io/coding%20journey,%20courses/2020/12/31/how-it-started.html), I took GRCC's [CIS 100 Intro to Computer Information Systems](https://catalog.grcc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=45&coid=69144) course, which was a traditional lecture class. As I worked through the course material, I realized what a difference my current perspective made in my interest on the content: 

When the textbook covered networking, it made practical sense to me because I'd frequently had to work with the I.T. department to ensure access to websites. Not surprisingly, journalism school and library school had not covered things like IP addresses and DNS. But I quickly became familiar with some of the questions I needed to ask and the sort of information I needed to convey, even if I didn't understand the nuts and bolts behind why things worked the way they did. 

At another point, the textbook talked about Microsoft 365, including its data visualization product [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/). And I remember getting excited because my workplace both had a Microsoft 365 subscription and collected stats *constantly*. I could completely see how Power BI would be useful for quickly conveying trends. I went into the work the next day and requested access to Power BI so I could start playing around with it.

My reaction honestly made me chuckle because when was the last time I'd ever gotten worked up by something I'd read in a textbook? Certainly not in my undergrad years.

In fact, had I been learning this material as an undergrad, I am certain it would have just seemed like dry, abstract chaff. At that time I had no sense of the real world and the tech that helped keep businesses running. So I am grateful that I am coming to this topic now, after having been "out in the world," and the perspective and experiences my career has given me. It makes what I am learning so much more relevant and concrete.
